#
# 1. Add email_spec to Gemfile:
#
# group :test do
#  gem 'email_spec'
# end

# 2. Create a file like this one you're reading in spec/support/email_spec.rb:
require 'email_spec'

RSpec.configure do |config|

  config.include EmailSpec::Helpers, [type: :mailer, type: :feature, type: :job]
  config.include EmailSpec::Matchers, [type: :mailer, type: :feature, type: :job]

  config.before(:each) do
    reset_mailer # Clears out ActionMailer::Base.deliveries
  end

end

# 3. Start making use of email_spec helpers and matchers. See specs in this project
#    for examples.
